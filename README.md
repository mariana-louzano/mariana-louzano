- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariana-louzano. I am not from this century, although I was pretty good at my Tumblr HTML. I grew up reading books and watching TV series. I had to be outgoing and fun to get people to like me in every city we moved to. After 2.5 years as a lawyer, I decided I wanted to be happy—and stress over code. So, here I am.
- 👀 I’m interested in product management, database, and everyhthing it takes a software engineer to be a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning promp engineering, AI, PostgreSQL, HTML, and Git of course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes me closer to my goal on tech.
- 📫 How to reach me: tiktok-instagram-youtube /mmarianalouzano 
- 😄 Pronouns: she
- ⚡ Fun fact: I did a master's degree in historical law in Portugal and I was a teacher for almost 2 years. I love history, but please don't ask me anything about law.
